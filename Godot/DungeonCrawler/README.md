## Installation
### Method 1 (Godot Asset Library)
The most simple way to get started using TODO Manager is to use Godot's inbuilt Asset Library to install the plugin into your project.
#### Step 1
Find TODO Manager in the Godot Asset Library.

#### Step 2
Install the package. You may want to untick the /doc folder at this point as it is not necessary for the functions of the plugin.

#### Step 2
- Unzip the file and add it into your project folder. Make sure 'addons' is a subdirectory of res://
- DO NOT change the name of the 'addons' or 'Todo_Manager' folders as this will break the saving and loading of your settings.

#### Step 3
Enable the plugin in the project settings.
